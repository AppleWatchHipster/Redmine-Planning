  # Convert the output of "structured_issue_list" to JavaScript,
  # writing out a script which assigns the result to global variable
  # "issueInfo". JavaScript file "dynamic_issue_list.js" can use data in
  # this format. Will also set "issueSel" based on array "@issue_selec";
  # the JavaScript code can use this to pre-select items in its various
  # selection lists.
  #
  # Whoever renders this template as a partial must wrap the output in
  # "<script>" tags or use whatever other encapsulation mechanism is
  # appropriate in context.
